Clay’s feeling good about the future. That changes in a hurry. The cause of the devastation is a phenomenon that will come to be known as The Pulseand the delivery method is a cell phone.

Clay and the few desperate survivors who join him suddenly find themselves in the pitch-black night of civilization’s darkest agesurrounded by chaoscarnageand a human horde that has been reduced to its basest nature...and then begins to evolve. There’s really no escaping this nightmare. But for Clayan arrow points home to Maineand as he and his fellow refugees make their harrowing journey north they begin to see crude signs confirming their direction. A promiseperhaps. Or a threat... There are 193 million cell phones in the United States alone. Who doesn’t have one?
